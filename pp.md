- **Zero Two** stores only the necessary data required for the Bot's functionality. For example, reminders, logs, or custom settings specific to your server.
- Data is stored securely and is retained only for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this policy.
- If you remove the Bot from your server, most of the stored data related to your server will be deleted, though certain anonymous or aggregated data may be retained for analytical purposes.

We do not share your data with third parties except under the following conditions:
- **Legal Obligations**: We may disclose data to comply with legal obligations, regulations, or valid legal requests (such as a subpoena).
